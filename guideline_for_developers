## First step is psychip.py
A. Check the requirements
    A1. Check that all the programs are visible in the scope (use 'which' function in utils/checker.py)
        - samtools has to be > 1.x
        - bwa
        - picard
        - bedtools
        - macs2 (they need to use the michael modification to use bedpe!!!) Clearly state in the manual this part and
                procedure to install.
        - python 2.7.x (think about switching to 3)
        - SPONGES!!! We need to specify how to use those for hg28 and for hg19 uses blacklist
    A2. Check the input
read1.fq        read2.fq        control.fq
read1_2.fq      read2_2.fq      control2.fq
        - Is the input correctly formatted and do the files exist. -p for paired
        - parameteres output_folder;qc;cpus;threads;quiet;intermediate_files;(bwa aln for future);index_bwa;sponges;genome;
            temp file location;chromosomeLength
